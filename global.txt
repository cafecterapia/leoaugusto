A respectable, cutting-edge global CSS file functions as the project's immutable constitution, establishing a single source of truth before any layout or component is considered. It begins with a modern CSS reset, followed by the :root selector, which houses the entire design system as a comprehensive set of CSS Custom Properties (design tokens). These tokens must abstractly define every foundational design decision: a full color palette, a typographic scale (font families, sizes, weights), a modular spacing and sizing system, border radii, and even z-index layers. This file sets the project's universal language, applying only the most basic defaults to the body tag and establishing global accessibility standards like :focus-visible styling, but never styling specific elements beyond this foundational layer.
Crucially, the integrity of a global CSS file is defined by its purity and what it aggressively excludes. It must be completely devoid of any component-specific selectors (like .button or .hero), complex layout rules (display: grid, grid-template-areas), ID selectors, and any form of contextual queries like @media or @container. Its sole purpose is to provide a context-free toolkit of design tokens that are consumed by separate layout and component stylesheets. This strict separation ensures that the visual identity of the project is centralized and easily maintainable, allowing for system-wide changes or theming (like a dark mode) to be implemented with surgical precision by simply redefining the root-level tokens, without ever touching the component or layout cod
