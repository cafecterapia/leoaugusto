RUST EDGE FUNCTION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
========================================

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT:

## Rust Edge Function Status
✅ File exists: api/hero-image.rs
✅ Dependencies optimized: Cargo.toml with release optimizations
✅ Multi-format support: AVIF, WebP, JPEG
✅ Aggressive caching: 1-year cache headers
✅ Performance headers: X-Vercel-Edge, compression hints
✅ Error-free compilation

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **IMAGE DELIVERY OPTIMIZATION**
   - Current: Using include_bytes! for static embedding
   - Potential: Consider streaming for large images
   - Current payload: Static AVIF embedded at compile time

2. **CACHE STRATEGY**
   - Current: Ultra-aggressive 1-year cache
   - Status: Optimal for static hero image

3. **COMPRESSION & FORMAT**
   - Current: AVIF priority with WebP/JPEG fallbacks
   - Status: Already using most efficient format

4. **EDGE PERFORMANCE**
   - Current: Rust Edge Function with vercel_runtime
   - Status: Maximum performance approach

## ASSESSMENT: RUST EDGE FUNCTION IS WELL-OPTIMIZED

The current Rust implementation already achieves maximum performance:
- Zero-latency image serving via include_bytes!
- Optimal caching strategy
- Best-in-class format support
- Ultra-fast Rust runtime

## FOCUS AREA: FRONTEND OPTIMIZATION

Based on gameplan analysis, the bottleneck is NOT the Edge Function
but the frontend LQIP strategy. The Rust Edge Function is performing
optimally and delivers the hero image as fast as technically possible.

## RECOMMENDATION

Keep the existing Rust Edge Function as-is.
Focus optimization efforts on the frontend BlurHash/LQIP strategy
as outlined in the gameplans to achieve <800ms loading target.
